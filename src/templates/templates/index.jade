    p Alternative documentation system for Adobe ExtendScript API

section

  :markdown
    The people at Yearbook Machine used to make extensive use of the ExtendScript API on a
    daily basis, but found the documentation system difficult to deal with.
    This is their solution to the problem. An attempt at making the ExtendScript
    API documentation more accessible and easier to use than the native Object
    Model Viewer.

    Feel free to [browse their documentation online](https://yearbook.github.io/esdocs),
    or even help us out over on [GitHub](https://github.com/yearbook/extendscript-api-documentation).

    The most recent changes can be found in the [GitHub fork by tinne](https://github.com/yearbook/extendscript-api-documentation).

    ## Acknowledgements

    This project was inspired by the fantastic work by [Theunis de
    Jong](http://www.jongware.com/idjshelp.html). Many thanks for his efforts
    and inspiration.

    We would also like to thank [Steven Bryant](http://forums.adobe.com/people/Steven..)
    for his valuable help with InDesign scripting.

    The people at [Yearbook Machine](http://www.yearbook.com) wrote large parts of the system, 
    without them wo would still stick to the native viewer.
